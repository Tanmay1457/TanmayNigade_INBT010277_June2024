Heart Disease Classification Task
Introduction
In this task, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using a given dataset. This dataset includes various medical attributes related to heart health. Our goal is to preprocess the data, explore it to understand the underlying patterns, implement different classification models, evaluate their performance, and ensure that our models generalize well without overfitting.

Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Objective: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

Loading the Data:

We start by loading the dataset from a local CSV file. This dataset contains various features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc., along with the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
Handling Missing Values:

Real-world data often contains missing values. We use a technique called imputation to fill these missing values. Specifically, we replace missing values with the mean of the respective columns to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
Encoding Categorical Variables:

Some features in our dataset might be categorical (e.g., gender). Machine learning models require numerical input, so we convert these categorical features into numerical format using a method called Label Encoding.
Scaling Numerical Variables:

To ensure that all features contribute equally to the model, we scale the numerical variables. This involves standardizing the features so they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Splitting the Dataset:

Finally, we split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train our models, while the testing set is used to evaluate their performance. This helps us understand how well our models will perform on unseen data.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns.

Correlation Matrix:

We visualize the correlation matrix to see how different features are related to each other and to the target variable. This helps us identify strong relationships and potential multicollinearity issues.
Pairplot:

A pairplot is used to visualize the distribution and relationships between pairs of features. By coloring the plot based on the target variable, we can observe how different features interact and contribute to the presence of heart disease.
Step 3: Model Implementation
Objective: Develop and train machine learning models to predict heart disease.

Choosing Models:

We implement three different models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. Each model has unique characteristics and strengths.
Training the Models:

We train each model using the training dataset. This involves feeding the training data into the model and adjusting its parameters to learn the patterns in the data.
Step 4: Model Evaluation
Objective: Assess the performance of the models.

Evaluation Metrics:

We use several metrics to evaluate the models: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of how well the models are performing.
Performance Comparison:

By comparing these metrics, we can identify which model performs best and whether there are any areas where the models need improvement.
Step 5: Cross Validation and Overfitting Check
Objective: Ensure the models generalize well to new data.

Detecting Overfitting:

Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on the testing data. This indicates that the model has learned the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns.
Cross-Validation:

To mitigate overfitting, we use a technique called cross-validation. This involves splitting the dataset into multiple parts, training the model on some parts, and testing it on others. By repeating this process, we ensure that our model performs consistently well across different subsets of the data.
Conclusion
By following these steps, we systematically approached the task of predicting heart disease. The combination of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, and thorough evaluation ensured that our models were robust and reliable. This comprehensive process not only helped in developing accurate models but also provided valuable insights into the dataset and the factors contributing to heart disease.
